# Chakra UI Bindings for Formik

[![license](https://badgen.now.sh/badge/license/MIT)](./LICENSE)

Bindings for using [Formik](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik) with [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io).

## Why?

[Inversion of Control](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/inversion-of-control) is
really cool and [Compound Components](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/inversion-of-control#compound-components) do provide really flexible API.

Yet this library is opinionated, provides bindings for Formik, with necessary paddings etc. You can easily opt-out continue to use Chakra UI if you need custom components. But this library will support %90 of the use-cases when building and form.

â„¹â„¹ This library is compatible with `chakra-ui@1` â„¹â„¹
